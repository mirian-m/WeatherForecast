# WeatherForecast

The Weather App for iOS is a powerful and feature-rich mobile application that provides users 
with accurate and real-time weather forecasts. The app is built using the VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) 
architectural pattern, which ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase. 
With VIP, the app separates its components into distinct layers, promoting a clear separation of concerns and making it easier to test and extend functionalities.

VIP Architecture

The VIP architecture consists of the following components:
View (View Controller): The View layer is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interactions. It communicates with the Presenter and displays the weather information received from the Interactor. The View is designed to be as passive as possible, avoiding direct business logic and data manipulation.
Interactor: The Interactor layer serves as the business logic component of the app. It communicates with the data layer (API or database) to fetch weather data and processes the data as needed before sending it to the Presenter. The Interactor is independent of the user interface, making it easily testable with unit tests.
Presenter: The Presenter acts as an intermediary between the View and the Interactor. It receives data from the Interactor and formats it in a way suitable for presentation in the View. The Presenter also handles user interactions from the View and communicates with the Interactor to perform specific actions based on user input.
Router: The Router handles navigation between different screens or modules in the app. It abstracts the navigation logic from the View, allowing the Presenter to focus solely on presenting data. The Router is responsible for creating and presenting View Controllers and can be used to manage the app's navigation stack.
Models: Models are simple data structures used to represent the data fetched from the Interactor. They are typically Swift structs or classes that store relevant information, such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, etc.

Benefits of VIP Architecture:

Separation of Concerns: The VIP architecture promotes a clear separation of responsibilities, making the codebase easier to manage and understand.
Testability: With the clear separation of components, each layer can be unit tested independently, improving code reliability and test coverage.
Scalability: The VIP pattern allows for the addition of new features and modifications without affecting other parts of the codebase.
Maintainability: By keeping business logic and UI logic separate, the code becomes more maintainable and less prone to bugs.
Readability and Code Consistency: The architecture's structure promotes clean code practices, leading to better readability and consistency across the project.

Technologies Used:

Swift: The app is developed entirely using the Swift programming language.
UIKit: UIKit framework is used for building the user interface components.
URLSession: URLSession is utilized for making API requests to fetch weather data.
Codable: Codable protocols are used for parsing JSON data into Swift objects.
